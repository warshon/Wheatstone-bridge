### About:
The Wheatstone bridge experiment is a fundamental component of the undergraduate physics curriculum, traditionally taught as a hands-on activity to explore resistance measurement and circuit balancing. 

In an undergraduate physics experiment, high sensitivity is critical for helping students observe and understand subtle variations in electrical resistance, providing a deeper insight into measurement accuracy and precision. 
Students gain practical circuit design and optimization skills by learning to adjust the circuit parameters to maximize sensitivity, bridging theoretical concepts with hands-on experimentation. 

However, conventional experimental setups may limit students' ability to explore the full range of parameters affecting bridge sensitivity. 
Manually adjusting each component in the bridge to optimize sensitivity can be timeconsuming, error-prone, and may not always lead to optimal values.

One software named WBOpt was developed using Bayesian optimization principles, allowing students to automatically determine the bridge configuration for maximum sensitivity and familiarizing them with modern physics and engineering practices, where simulation and optimization are essential.
